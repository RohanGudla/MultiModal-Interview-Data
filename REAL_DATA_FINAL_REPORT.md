## 🚀 Technical Insights from Real Data

### What We Learned:
1. **Real data makes a massive difference**: 40+ percentage point improvements across all models
2. **Pretrained models dominate**: ImageNet transfer learning is crucial for small datasets
3. **ViT excellence**: Attention mechanisms perfect for facial emotion recognition
4. **Data quality matters**: Even 20 real frames + variants > 100 synthetic frames
5. **Two-phase training effective**: Classifier first, then backbone fine-tuning works well

### Limitations & Challenges:
- **Single source video**: Only LE 3299 provided real frames (others corrupted)
- **Small dataset**: 100 total frames still relatively small
- **Perfect accuracy**: May indicate overfitting despite controls
- **Limited participants**: Variants based on single individual

## 🎯 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Repair corrupted videos**: Fix remaining 4 GENEX videos for more real data
2. **Test set evaluation**: Hold out data for final unbiased assessment  
3. **Cross-validation**: More robust evaluation methodology
4. **More frames**: Extract 50+ frames per participant

### Advanced Features:
1. **Temporal modeling**: Add sequence understanding with RNNs/LSTMs
2. **Multi-modal fusion**: Integrate audio features from interviews
3. **Attention visualization**: Understand what ViT focuses on in faces
4. **Real-time inference**: Optimize for deployment
