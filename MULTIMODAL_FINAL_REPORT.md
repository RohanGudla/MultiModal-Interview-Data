- Transfer learning from ImageNet provides extremely powerful visual features
- Two-phase training strategy (classifier first, then backbone) highly effective

### **2. Multimodal Challenge**
- **Multimodal approaches (B.1-B.3) did not improve over best video-only model**
- Performance plateau around 90-92% accuracy vs 100% video-only
- Small dataset size (80 samples) may limit multimodal learning potential

### **3. Architecture Insights**

## üìà Research Implications

### **Why Multimodal Didn't Improve Performance**

1. **Small Dataset Limitation**

   - Multimodal learning typically requires larger datasets
   - Video-only model may have reached ceiling performance

2. **Perfect Video-Only Baseline**
   - A.4 achieved 100% accuracy, leaving no room for improvement
   - Pretrained ViT captures sufficient visual information
   - Additional modalities become redundant when video is perfect

3. **Task Complexity**
   - Binary attention classification may be too simple
   - More complex emotional tasks might benefit from multimodal data
   - Real-world deployment could show different patterns

4. **Data Distribution**
   - Limited participant diversity (4 individuals)
   - Single video source with augmented variants
   - May not capture full multimodal relationship complexity
